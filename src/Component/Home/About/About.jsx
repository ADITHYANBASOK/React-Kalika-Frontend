        Have you ever paused to think about the physically challenged who are denied a chance to flourish because of a disability? We at kalika have just done exactly that. We paused, thought and came up with an idea to empower the disabled and to lend a hand to help them reach full their potential. We are a platform which helps them to reach out and explore the markets to sell their products from the comfort of their homes. Let us help them flourish and just be as happy as us.
